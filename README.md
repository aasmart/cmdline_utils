# Cmdline Utils

A collection of useful scripts I'm trying to write to make things on the command line easier

## Scripts

### ghclone

Uses `fzf` to quickly search through your GitHub repositories and clone a selection

### ghinit

Initializes a GH repository in an arbitrary directory and tries to add your current changes and clone them.
